# A* Search Algorithm Implementations
These are two algorithmic implementations of A * (A Star) in Python, where one uses a matrix for navigation and another uses a graphs structure, but not completely, because it uses part of python's own structure, for example it was created the Vertex class and for the edges were used a map with the item names to a list of tuples containing the target item names and the weight of that edge. That way, from each vertex, we can know the path and weight to their adjacent.

## Prerequisites
It takes Python 3 to execute the ".py" files and Jupyter Notebook (IPython) to execute the ".ipynb" files.
